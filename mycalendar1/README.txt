The string "Day    Time   Subject" was assigned to the variable "title".
I used the print command to print the variable "title". 
The strings "Monday" and "Tuesday" were assigned to the variables "Day1" and Day2" respectively.
The strings "9:10-10:15 AM", "10:35-11:40 AM", and "12:10-1:15 PM" were assigned to the variables "Time1", "Time2", and "Time3" respectively.
I used the print command to print the remaining lines in this format:
Day (ex: Day1)  Time(ex: Time3) Subject(ex: Wheel)
